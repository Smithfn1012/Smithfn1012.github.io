The thing about being brave enough to suck at something new is that you have to attempt to completely remove your ego. 

This is a difficult task for me, I am always on one side or the other. It's either, "Oh, I can do that, no problem!" or ,"there is no way that I could ever do that!"

I am a stay-at-home mom of three kids that I homeschool and travel the US with, I am a wife to my husband of 6 years, and now I am also taking this class to become a software engineer. It has forced me to learn things about myself that I wouldn't have realized otherwise. 

I am impatient and can get frustrated about little things quickly. I also have a lot of trouble with imposter syndrome. I know that I really enjoy learning to be a programmer but I also worry that I am not up to par or not capable of fully understanding what is going on. However, at the same time I have learned a lot about my determination, resilience, and eagerness to understand and grow as a programmer. There is nothing like the adrenaline rush of debugging for hours and finding an extra '/' that is throwing everything off, so you fix it.... save it.... test it......... and OMG it works!! Pure joy and elation!

I am 2 1/2 months into this program and I have noticed how my thought process has started to shift. Instead of thinking about the problem itself I think about where did the problem originate, and run through steps, like I would with coding. Ultimately, I believe that is a good change and will assist me with my general problem solving skills throughout life.

I believe learning to think like a programmer has changed me as an inidividual and has increased my ability to easily navigate through day to day issues.
