It took me several days to narrow down exactly what I wanted my project to be about and how I wanted to accomplish this major goal! I searched how to create a ruby gem with bundler and found hundreds of examples. It was difficult to not be intimidated by the complexity of some of the code that I found! 

First, I wanted to create an api using Spotify to create a fanpage gem that would allow you to access all the information about that artist, their songs, their albums, and their upcoming events. I got about two days into this project before I realized that I was way in over my head and have to meet a deadline. 

Second, I decided to scrape a travel website and create a list of 2020 top travel destinations. I thought I had completed the code on this project and then my files disappeared. At this point, I was frustrated and upset, but nevertheless I persisted.

Third, I decided to make a concert finding gem to list upcoming concerts. I searched for a concert venue local to me and settled on Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Denver, Colorado. I scraped information from https://redrocksonline.com using Nokogiri to provide a comprehensive list of artists that have upcoming shows at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Then, I ask the user to input the number cooresponding with the artist they are interested in seeing to get additional information about date, time, and ticket information for the upcoming event.

Fourth, I worked the list we were given to create a gem in three days, watched videos on youtube and uploaded open office hour videos, searched on google more than ever before, reached out to class mates, and finally pieced everything together correctly!! 

In conclusion, this was one of the most stressful/exciting/frustrating/blissful things that I have ever chose to put myself through. There were definitely moments of being overwhelmed but nothing compared to my code working and submitting my project on time!! If you get overwhelmed please don't be afraid to reach out and use all the resources available to you!! That is the only way I was able to complete this project!! 

Good luck with your future and happy coding!!
