It is hard to believe that I am here, I have finally made it to the end of my journey with Flatiron! For this project, I wanted to do something fun that would be useful to most age groups! So, I created an informational app about the different biomes and the animals and plants that live in those biomes!

For this project, I created a custom Rails json API, the backend database was built to securely store and send data about biomes, animals, and plants. 
On the frontend, I used React and Redux to handle over 10 states. 
I created 8 routes and passed information between over 25 components. 
The user interface was designed with slider and forms with Semantic UI React, custom CSS, and React Transition Group. Used react library Strider to create an interactive quiz. 

I really enjoyed this project and learning how to use all of the new libraries and integrate everthing that we have learned so far into this project! I have overcome several obstacles during this journey and I am so glad that I chose Flatiron! I am extremely excited about my future as a Software Engineer!
