Learning Ruby on Rails has been a great deal of fun. I became very comfortable with the MVC structure, while learning Sinatra, and feel like it was the perfect way to introduce Rails. However, I am having a little bit of difficulty remembering the syntax for forms in Rails but I am sure, with some practice and google, it is something I will get very familiar with. Overall, I am amazed at how powerful Rails is and am truly excited to learn more about the in's and out's of this incredible extension of Ruby!
