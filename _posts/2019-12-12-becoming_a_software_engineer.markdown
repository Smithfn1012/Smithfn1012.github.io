Hello everyone! 

My name is Felicia Smith and I am currently attending Flatiron School to become a Software Engineer. 
I have been married to my husband, Robert Smith, for almost eight years. 
Robert earned his national crane certification about three years ago. So, we picked up our family and have been traveling across the US together ever since. We have three children, Caidan is 12, Malachi is 6, and Marlee is 3. I home-school them while we travel and my husband is at work. The last few years have been a lot of fun but I had an intense yearning to figure out what MY purpose was or what MY career path should be. I researched several different careers and venues and software engineering definitely peaked my interest the most. I truly enjoy the idea of being in an ever changing and evolving environment that will keep me intrigued and will always allow room for growth. The tech industry is so vast and it is still growing at such an intense rate. I am excited to be a part of that!! I also love the idea of being able to see the fruits of my labor, to be working on something for hours/days/weeks/etc... and finally get to watch the code run must be such an awesome feeling! I started looking into coding tutorials and learning the basics after I decided that this was the direction that I wanted to go. I had been learning what I could on my own for about two years and finally decided that it was time to enroll in a bootcamp and really jumpstart my career. Flatiron offered the most flexible options for classes, class length, payment options, and had an amazing graduation and new-hire rate. I have truly enjoyed my journey with Flatiron so far and cannot wait to see what life will bring after I complete this bootcamp and become a Software Engineer.
