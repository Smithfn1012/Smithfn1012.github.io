Let me start by saying that in the last month I feel that I have learned so much! 
For my first project I have decided to create a fanpage api. In this example I will be pulling information from Spotify to allow the user to read the artists' biography, view a list of the artists' top- songs, all of their albums, or upcoming events. As soon as I decided what I wanted to do I realized that I really had no idea where to start. The guides were definitely helpful!! What caught me up the most was learning how to actually use Spotify in my code, it requires special authorization and offers up a lot more information than I neccessarily needed. However, I am committed to finishing my project by the deadline and continuing my experience with this cohort. Throughout this experience I have learned that this will be more difficult than I anticipated but that's ok because I am getting out of comfort zone and working towards a new goal and I won't let myself down! As I complete my first project I know that I have made the best decision and there is nowhere but up from here! My hope is that if you are also struggling that you will not get discouraged and that you will also power through and finish this thing! We've got this!
