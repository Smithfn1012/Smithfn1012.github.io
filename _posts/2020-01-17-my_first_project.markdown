Let me start by saying that in the last month I feel that I have learned so much! 
For my first project I have decided to create a top travel destination api. In this example I will be pulling information from Lonelyland to allow the user to choose between top countries, top cities, top regions, and top best values. Additionally, after you make your selection an informative response will be printed on the screen. As soon as I decided what I wanted to do I realized that I really had no idea where to start. I was originally going to create a fanpage api using Spotify but realized that was a little over my head over half-way through it. So, I decided to find some simple tutuorials and copy the information while filling it with the new information that I found. Although this has been more difficult that I expected but I am committed to finishing my project by the deadline and continuing my experience with this cohort. This experience has definantly brought me out of comfort zone and I truly enjoy working towards a new goal and I won't let myself down! I know that I have made the best decision about my career path and there is nowhere but up from here! My hope is that if you are also struggling that you will not get discouraged and that you will also power through and finish this thing! We've got this!
